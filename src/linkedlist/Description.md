Linked List is a linear data structure in which each list contains value and a pointer to the next linked list.
It is dynamic in nature that means we can add, remove data at runtime. It is mainly used for easy insertion and deletion
of data on and from the list. It is an unordered List.

Here there is abstraction as we don't have access to the pointers and we can pnly access the data which is good.
We don't have to worry about maintaining the data structure we just need to worry only for inserting deleting and
searching in the linked list.

Unlike Array which is fixed in nature we do not need to shift data for removal or insertion of elements.

Advantages:
Quicker in insertion and deletion of data
Used to implement stacks and queues

Disadvantages:
Still slower in traversal and searching the nodes.
More memory is required for storing elements in linked list.
